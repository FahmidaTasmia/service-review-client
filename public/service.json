As Big Data continues to permeate our day-to-day lives, there has been a significant shift of focus from the hype surrounding it to finding real value in its use.Generally, most organizations have several goals for adopting Big Data projects. While the primary goal for most organizations is to enhance customer experience, other goals include cost reduction, better-targeted marketing, and making existing processes more efficient. In recent times, data breaches have also made enhanced security an important goal that Big Data projects seek to incorporate.",

The label as a service references a pay-per-use business model that does not require the customer to purchase or manage infrastructure for data management.DMaaS is typically an operating expense that goes up and down based on how much service the customer is consuming. It is technically possible to provide DMaaS using on-premises infrastructure, or a private cloud offered by the DMaaS vendor, but all infrastructure must be provided and managed by the DMaaS vendor to be considered a service. Although it may be possible to do data management as a service this way, it is prohibitive to do so for logistical and cost reasons.",

Also known as “interactive visual exploration,” it enables the exploration of data via the manipulation of chart images, with the color, brightness, size, shape and motion of visual objects representing aspects of the dataset being analyzed. It includes an array of visualization options that go beyond those of pie, bar and line charts, including heat and tree maps, geographic maps, scatter plots, and other special-purpose visuals.

Individual investors gain access to these reports mainly by having accounts with the brokerage firm.The challenge facing the brokerages is it's extremely expensive to create all this research.
